## How to run
Script takes two command line arguments 

>1. (Optional) auction_link_url i.e 'https://www.easyliveauction.com/auctioneers/2020auctions/' [default]
>2. (Optional) resilience i.e 'y' [must have a first argument also] 
>2. (Optional) background i.e 'y' [must have a second and first argument also]

>1. Select the auction house from the following https://www.easyliveauction.com/auctioneers/, insert into the first parameter.  

>2. Existence of the second argument 'y' will mean the auctions will not be looked up, instead will be read from the DB. 

>3. Existence of the third argument will mean the script is run as a background process. 

i.e to run not in resilience mode and in the background, please see the below.

> ./run_script.sh https://www.easyliveauction.com/auctioneers/2020auctions/ n y
